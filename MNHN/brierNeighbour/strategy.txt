# générer couples de aa test

1- create a file with at each line:   # to read once
(pid_seed, name_1, name_2, len_seq) # for each valid couple


2- for a context structure [G1, D1, G2, D2]:
add for each line the list of valid position (according to the context)

3- creat a dictionary:
random selection of a line in the file hence of a couple of sequences
key: (pid_seed, name_1, name_2, len_seq, list_valid_index)
random selection of a valid position
value: list_of_random_valid_index_selected
